# Healthcare Sector Employee Attrition Exploratory Data Analysis
## Introduction
In this notebook we are going to apply an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to the Watson Health Care employees dataset. The dataset contains employee and company data useful for supervised ML, unsupervised ML, and analytics.

The main scope of the EDA is to analyse and find insights about the employees and the patterns or factors driving them quitting the job.
